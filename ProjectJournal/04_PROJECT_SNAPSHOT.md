# Project Snapshot

This file is meant to help the project owner quickly resume work after breaks, chat resets, or low-credit days.

## What This Project Is Trying To Be

A focused VR learning experience for computer architecture, centered on helping learners reason through single-cycle MIPS datapath execution more effectively than static diagrams alone.

## Current Agreed Direction

The project should:
- answer the "why VR?" question through guided spatial reasoning
- focus on one learning objective first
- use VR for meaningful physical/spatial choices
- use UI for lookup tables, prompts, and explanations

## Current Active Prototype Area

Scene:
- `D:\CompArchVR\ThePrototype\Assets\Scenes\Testing Ground.unity`

Current prototype features:
- placeholder CPU nodes
- working physical XR push button
- highlight progression through nodes
- early instruction-system script scaffolding

## Most Important Scripts Right Now

- `D:\CompArchVR\ThePrototype\Assets\MyScripts\CpuNodeSequenceController.cs`
- `D:\CompArchVR\ThePrototype\Assets\MyScripts\InstructionSystemV1\InstructionDefinition.cs`
- `D:\CompArchVR\ThePrototype\Assets\MyScripts\InstructionSystemV1\InstructionFlowControllerDraft.cs`

## Recommended Development Order

1. `add`
2. `addi`
3. `lw`

Why:
- `add` teaches the cleanest register-register path
- `addi` adds immediate handling without memory complexity
- `lw` adds address calculation and memory read/write-back behavior

## Current Non-Negotiable Milestone

- by `2026-06-28`, `add`, `addi`, and `lw` should be working
- on `2026-06-29`, this should be ready to show the supervisor as a V1 checkpoint
- this is the current deadline target, not a promise that the whole dissertation will stop at those three instructions

## If Starting A New Chat

Useful prompt:

`Please read ProjectJournal/00_README.md, 02_MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md, 03_GUIDELINES.md, 01_PROGRESS_LOG.md, and 05_DECISION_LOG.md before suggesting or making changes.`

## If Credits Are Running Low

Before stopping:
- ask for the relevant journal files to be updated
- make sure `01_PROGRESS_LOG.md` reflects the current state
- make sure any major scope shift is written into `05_DECISION_LOG.md`

## Current Open Questions

- how much of instruction decode should be physical vs UI-driven
- how explicit the control-signal interactions should be in the first version
- whether instruction choice is user-selected, randomized, or both

## Best Resume Point For The Next Development Session

The cleanest next work item is:
- define the `add` lesson as a gated stage flow first
- decide the player actions required at each stage so the same structure can extend into `addi` and `lw`
- reshape the instruction scripts toward stage/requirement-driven progression

## Personal Reminder

If the project feels too large, that is not a sign the concept is bad.
It is usually a sign that the lesson objective needs to be narrowed again.
